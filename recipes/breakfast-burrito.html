    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs: Beat eggs in a medium mixing bowl with a fork just until blended, set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage: Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble in chorizo (or add bacon) and cook, while breaking up and tossing, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer chorizo to a sheet of foil lined with paper towels, wrap to keep warm. Leave rendered sausage fat in skillet.</li>
        <li>Saute potatoes: Pour 1 Tbsp oil into skillet with sausage drippings, heat over medium-high. Add potatoes (stand back the may splatter since frozen), season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned and cooked through, about 7 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a sheet of foil lined with paper towels, wrap to keep warm. There should be just a little oil left behind in the skillet if not drizzle in about 1 tsp olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cook eggs: Heat skillet over medium-low heat. Add eggs and cook, scrapping bottom of a pan constantly with a rubber spatula and folding edges of eggs inward, just until eggs are nearly set, season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm, theyâ€™ll continue to cook from residual heat of pan.</li>
        <li>Warm tortillas: Heat tortillas on a griddle, in a large skillet or in the microwave until heated through.</li>
        <li>Layer ingredients over tortillas and wrap: To assemble, layer 1/4 of the eggs in a row in the center of each tortilla. Top each with 1/4 of the potatoes. Divide cheese among each then sprinkle with sausage. Spoon a few big spoonfuls of pico de gallo over each, top with avocado. Wrap two sides of tortilla inward then roll bottom over and roll and wrap snuggly. Serve with Mexican hot sauce.</li>
